              We are web development and design specialists.
            %p
              We prize elegance and simplicity over an endless feature set or complicated design. Our designs are minimalistic and modern. Our development efforts aim to expend the most effort towards the features that will be used most.
            %p
              We also focus intensely on agility and speed to remain cost effective. As such, startups and small businesses make ideal clients for us.

            %h3 The Story
            %p
              We nerds founded Monokai Code Company because we love technology and design. We love picking apart our own work and carefully piecing it back together. We love the sensation of anticipation and pride we feel every time we present our creations to our clients.
            %p
              Building cool things with technology is what we do. We don't outsource our contracts overseas. There are no client managers between you and the people who write the code. If we screw up, we'll just tell you and hope you understand (while we hurry to fix it). That's who we are.
